Hi, my name is Mustafa Kaan. I am currently working as a research assistant and continue my MSc program in CS. I am curious about data science and machine learning related topics. During my MSc, I did research about document classification and author profiling on social media. 

<!-- - In academics, not all of your work result in an output such as a research paper because you investigate different methods and approaches but only a part of the work become suitable with your research hypothesis. In this personal blog, I will share about all the stuff even not end up with a good result. 
- Besides academic research, I spent a lot of time with the business cases in the job applications and interviews. I will also share what I learned in these projects. -->
